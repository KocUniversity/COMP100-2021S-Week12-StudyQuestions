# Study Questions for Logarithmic and Exponential Complexity
## Quick Recap

A logarithmic function is the opposite of an exponential function. When you say something grows exponentially, itâ€™s being 
multiplied. When something grows logarithmically, it is being divided. Same thing happens in the functions.

## Q1
What is the time-complexity of these code segments?

__Example 1:__
```
i = 1
N= 10000
while i<N:
  i = i*3
```
__Your answer:__ ...


__Example 2:__
```
x = n 
while x > 0: 
  y = x 
  while y > 0:
      y = y / 2 
   
  x = x / 2 
```
__Your answer:__ ...


__Example 3:__

```
x = n 
while x > 0: 
  y = x 
  while y > 0:
      y = y - 1
  x = x / 2 
```
__Your answer:__ ...


__Example 4:__ 

```
# Python program to display the Fibonacci sequence

def recur_fibo(n):
   if n <= 1:
       return n
   else:
       return(recur_fibo(n-1) + recur_fibo(n-2))

nterms = 10

# check if the number of terms is valid
if nterms <= 0:
   print("Plese enter a positive integer")
else:
   print("Fibonacci sequence:")
   for i in range(nterms):
       print(recur_fibo(i))
```
